# Market-Basket-Analysis-on-Store-Products


The "Market Basket Analysis on Store Products" project is a comprehensive examination of customer purchasing behaviour within departmental stores. The dataset comprises a list of all items available in these stores, along with the quantity purchased by customers. The project utilizes statistical methods, along with visualization tools such as Seaborn and Matplotlib, to uncover meaningful patterns and associations among store products.

Through the application of the Apriori algorithm implemented in R using the 'arules' library, the analysis delves into identifying frequent itemsets and association rules. This algorithm allows us to unveil relationships between items that are frequently purchased together, offering valuable insights into customer preferences and the dynamics of product co-occurrence.
