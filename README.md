# Market-Basket-Analysis-on-Store-Products


The "Market Basket Analysis on Store Products" project is a comprehensive examination of customer purchasing behaviour within departmental stores. The dataset comprises a list of all items available in these stores, along with the quantity purchased by customers. The project utilizes statistical methods, along with visualization tools such as Seaborn and Matplotlib, to uncover meaningful patterns and associations among store products.

Through the application of the Apriori algorithm implemented in R using the 'arules' library, the analysis delves into identifying frequent itemsets and association rules. This algorithm allows us to unveil relationships between items that are frequently purchased together, offering valuable insights into customer preferences and the dynamics of product co-occurrence.

The project employs descriptive statistics and data visualization to present key findings in an accessible manner. Seaborn and Matplotlib are utilized to create insightful visual representations of the patterns discovered, enhancing the interpretability of the results.

The ultimate goal of this project is to provide store managers, marketers, and decision-makers with actionable insights for optimizing product placement, marketing strategies, and inventory management. By understanding the associations between products, the "Market Basket Analysis on Store Products" project aims to enhance the overall shopping experience for customers and drive business growth.
